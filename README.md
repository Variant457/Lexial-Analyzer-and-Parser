# Lexial-Analyzer-and-Parser
This was a project I completed in Spring 2025 for my Programming Languages class to learn more about how programming languages break down code and parses it to gain the necessary information needed to generate intermediate code.

I may update this project later if I go back to review the material to endure I mastered this topic.
